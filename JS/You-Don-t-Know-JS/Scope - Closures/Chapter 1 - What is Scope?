## Compiler Theory
Though JavaScript may seem like a dynamic or interpreted language, it is in fact a compiled language. There are typically
three steps a compiled language goes through before it is executed. This is called /compilation/

1. Tokenizing / Lexing:
* Tokenizing is when a string of characters is broken up into meaningful (to the language) chunks called tokens. For instance:
`var a = 2;` would be broken into the following tokesn `var`, `a`, `=`, `2`, `;`. 
* The difference between lexing and tokenizing is subtle, but centers on whether `a` should be considered a distinct token
or  just part of another token

2. Parsing:
* Parsing takes a stream (array) of tokens and turns it into a nested tree of elements. The tree is called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* The tree for `var a = 2;` might look like this:
```
VariableDeclaration (`var`)
  Identifier (`a`)
    AssignmentExpression (`=`)
      NumericLiteral (`2`)
```

3. Code Generation:
* Code generation is the process of taking an AST and turning it into executable code
* There is a way to take the above AST and turn it into a set of machine instructions (0s and 1s)  to /actually/ create a variable
called `a` (this includes reserving memory, etc.) and then store the value into `a`

## Understanding Scope
Understanding scope can be thought of as a conversation

#### The Cast
1. /The Engine/ - responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of a JS progra,
2. /The Compiler/ - handles the "dirty work" of parsing and code generation
3. /The Scope/ - collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set
of rules asd to how they are accessible to currently executing code

#### Back & Forth
When something like `var a = 2;` is seen by the /The Engine/, it isn't seen as one item, but rather two distinct statements; 
One which /The Compiler/ will handle, and one which /The Engine/ will handle (during execution)

The way /The Compiler/ sees this and handles is it not as straightforward as you might think:
1. Ecountering `var a`, /The Compiler/ asks /The Scope/ to see if a variable `a` already exists for that particular scope
If so, /The Compiler/ ignores it and moves on. Otherwise, /The Compiler/ asks /The Scope/ to declare a new variable
2. /The Compiler/ then produces code for /The Engine/ to later execute, to handle the `a = 2` assignment.
The code /The Engine/ runs will first ask /The Scope/ if there is a variable called `a` that is accessible in the current scope
If so, /The Engine/ uses that variable, if not, it looks elsewhere

#### Compiler Speak
To fully understand we need to understand more terminology relating to /The Compiler/
When /The Engine/ executes the code that /Compiler/ produces it has to look up the variable `a` to see if it has been declared
(consulting /The Scope/
However, the type of look up /The Engine/  performs affects the look up of /The Compiler/

/The Engine/ in this case is performing Left-Hand Side (LHS) look up versus Right-Hand Side (RHS) look up
* These refer to the side of the assignment operation.
* To be more precise, RHS is indistinguishable from a simple look up, whereas LHS look up is trying to find the variable container itself so that it can assign. 

For example, when we have:
```
console.log(a);
```
The reference `a` is an RHS reference, because nothing is assigned to `a` here, but rather is being looked up to retrieve the value
 
By contrast:
```
a = 2
```
is an LHS reference because we don't care what the value is, we just want to find the variable as a target for the assignment

For more clarity, you can split the two look up methods into the following:
1. LHS = "who's the target of the assignment" --> in this case, `a`
2. RHS = "who's the source of the assignment" --> in this case, `2`

Consider the following:
```
function foo(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

foo(2);
```
The invocation of `foo` is a RHS reference, while the passed argument of `2` is an LHS reference (assigning 2 to a)
The LHS reference here /literally/ assigns `2` to `a` before running the rest of the code block

It may make sense to conceptualize the function declaration `function foo(a) {..}` as a normal variable declaration (`var foo`)
However, there is a subtle difference in that /The Compiler/ handles both the declaration and the value definition during
code gen. This makes it so when /The Engine/ is executing code, there's no processing necessary to "assign" a function value
to `foo`. Therefore, it's not really an LHS in the way we've discussed them so far

#### Engine / Scope Conversation
```
function foo(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

foo(2);
```
The conversatiion between /The Scope/ and /The Engine/ would look like this

/Engine/: Hey Scope, I have an RHS reference for foo. Ever heard of it?

/Scope/: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.

/Engine/: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing foo.

/Engine/: Hey, Scope, I've got an LHS reference for a, ever heard of it?

/Scope/: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it as a formal parameter to foo just recently. Here you go.

/Engine/: Helpful as always, Scope. Thanks again. Now, time to assign 2 to a.

/Engine/: Hey, Scope, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for console. Ever heard of it?

/Scope/: No problem, Engine, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got console. He's built-in. Here ya go.

/Engine/: Perfect. Looking up log(..). OK, great, it's a function.

/Engine/: Yo, Scope. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to a. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.

/Scope/: You're right, Engine. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.

/Engine/: Cool. Passing the value of a, which is 2, into log(..).


### Quiz:
```
function foo(a) {
  var b = a;
  return b + a;
}

var c = foo(2);
```
1. Identify all LHS look ups (3 total)
2. Identify all RHS look ups (4 total)

##### Answer
1. First: `function foo(a) {..}` Second: `var b = a` Third: `var c = foo(2)`
2. First:
